--Declaring IEEE library to be able to call a standard logic vector later
library IEEE:
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;

--Initializing the entity portion
ENTITY sevenseg_disp IS
	PORT( input: IN std_logic_vector(3 DOWNTO 0); --declares the input for the seven segment display as 4 bits: 0 to 3 (maximum value of 9)
			output: OUT std_logic_vector(6 DOWNTO 0) ); --declares the output for the seven segment display as 7 bits: one bit for each segment on the display
end; --declares that the entity portion is done

--Initializing the architecture portion
ARCHITECTURE encoding OF sevenseg_disp IS
	SIGNAL internal: std_logic_vector(7 DOWNTO 0); --declares SIGNAL architecture called "internal", 8 bits allow for the hex to read in two sections of 4 bits
	begin
		WITH input SELECT --declares what hex value is assigned to what value to display the hex value assignment to the seven segment display
			internal <= x"40" WHEN x"0",
							x"79" WHEN x"1",
							x"24" WHEN x"2",
							x"30" WHEN x"3",
							x"19" WHEN x"4",
							x"12" WHEN x"5",
							x"02" WHEN x"6",
							x"78" WHEN x"7",
							x"00" WHEN x"8",
							x"18" WHEN x"9",
							x"09" WHEN OTHERS; --segments 0 and 3 are off to make an H or X (however you look at it) pattern.
		output <= internal(6 DOWNTO 0);
end; --declares the end of the architecture portion

How was the decoder synthesized? 
Out of seven multiplexers, each for a segment on the display.

Was this what you expected? 
No.

Can you make sense of what is shown?
Yes, each multiplexer is for one segment on the display. Each switch is one select line on the 
multiplexer to where the multiplexer takes signal data from the VDHL code to determine whether
the segment is on or off. There are 16 states possible in the muxes because there four select
lines, so 2^4 states.

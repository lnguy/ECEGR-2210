--Declaring IEEE library to be able to call a standard logic vector later
library IEEE;

--Initializing the entity portion
ENTITY sevenseg_disp IS
	PORT( input: IN std_logic_vector(3 DOWNTO 0); --declares the input for the seven segment display as 4 bits: 0 to 3 (maximum value of 9)
			output: OUT bit_vector (6 DOWNTO 0) ); --declares the output for the seven segment display as 7 bits: one bit for each segment on the display
end; --declares that the entity portion is done

--Initializing the architecture portion
